# K Dub You Ree Mee In Progreh

Welcome to my github page, im looking to use this more and more going forward. I will be working on things here and there: Mainly private repo stuff but I am keen to use this space to facilitate
my game design journey

I speak in wavering metaphor constantly (see Game Design is Metaphor blog,) I am verbose in all the wrong ways, I say words I only know the feeling of. I am a designer of many things. Thank you for reading


### Im currently working on

Im currently working on a game about being a sad longing robot tasked with taking photos

Learning how to make a game with more systems and data than I normally would comprehend; a roguelike

Turning Kooky Sharks into a fully realized released experience

### I have worked on
- Itch Page Stuff

- Personal Dnd Stuff 


### I want to work on
- More games. I love design, I love making insane and unreadable visual messes (see D/M/T & Apocalypsol)
- So much more too


### I am wanting to learn

- How to save data for different types of games
- Simplistic Multiplayer and the degrees in which it needs to be applied
- 3D modelling
- How to do everything I want to and also make money at the same time. Sounds awesome in theory.



### ðŸ’¬ Ask Me About
- Feedback on your creative thing, whatever it is. I am quite skilled in the nature of putting words to a feeling that is unrelated to the words I am speaking. 
I will give flowery feedback and I will give direct, targeted thought provoking feedback. It is something I find pride in being able to do, some would say effictively.
- DND, I love dnd. I find myself to be quite a good storyteller to some extent. I am confident in company.



### âš¡ Fun fact:
I also do music stuff, technically haven't made it for anyone else before but only because it wasn't used. So, I like myself i guess.
